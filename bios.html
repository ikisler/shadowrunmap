				<div class="bio-description">
					<p>I go by my World of Warcraft username, JASONnARGO. Argo is the 'deck. I'm Jason. Don't talk to Argo, she won't talk back.</p>

					<p>I'm a decker, and a damn good one, too. I've seen all sorts of things on the matrix, chummer: I've seen corporate secrets that'll make you shake in yer boots, WoW guilds go to war and bring down entire sections of the matrix, viruses that eat your mind... hell, I've even seen ghosts in the works.</p>

					<p>You won't often see me out and about (I prefer to have my pizza delivered, thanks), but when you do, you'll know me; I'll be wearing black and white checkered pants, a neon T-shirt, and my best black blazer. If it's a formal event, I'll even wear a tie. No, I'm not a rocker, I just have great taste in fashion.</p>

					<p>(Jason is the child of a pizza delivery man and a jazz singer. He first got into decking while working at RadioShack -- using their connection, of course.)</p>

				<div class="bio-description">
				<p>I worked for SmallWiFly out of college and enjoyed making rotary drones near Denver. Listening to four friends, I got into ...big troubles. After being laid off, consulting gigs in the PCC and Calfreestate gave me a new love. A little bitty snoop job or two and here I am three years later, renting in Seattle, looking over someone else's shoulder and competing on forum TV trivia contests.</p>

				<p>Stands 125 cm tall, less stocky than the usual dwarf. Short blond hair with a handlebar mustache. Expressive mobile blue eyes. On the 'Run, usually dresses in a black armor jacket, blue watch cap, black cargo pants, khaki turtleneck and shop floor work boots. My clubbing clothes include a top hat (I'm Down Here), royal blue fancy suit, dark blue slacks and elevator shoes.</p>

				<div class="bio-description">
				<p>"There were four of us up in that high-rise hotel, and I was the only one who came out alive. And that's only because I let them cuff me. I was locked up for eight weeks until pulled strings kicked in, but before I got out I knew that everyone else on that job had vanished. Even before that, I knew. Before I left the hotel that night, before the fuzzies got me to the lobby. I knew it when they were putting the bracelets on.</p>
				
				<p>We were set up, and from the inside."</p>

				<div class="bio-description">
				<p>I don't know who I am. I don't know who I've lost, just that I've lost someone. I remember bits about her sometimes, flashbacks when I see some things. My best lead involved a flower seller or florist somewhere. I'm not sure how old I am, but a doctor estimated I was in my mid-twenties. My arrest records tend to vanish, I don't know why, and it bothers me sometimes. I suspect that my official SIN might be on file somewhere, and someone's trying to make sure whoever I was stays dead.</p>

				<p>For now, I'm just trying to keep going. I've spent the last few years as a merc, bounty hunting and shadowrunning mainly. Eventually, I'll find something, remember something, that will lead me to her. Or maybe myself. Whatever it leads me to, it will be an end. Perhaps my own.</p>
